SmartIncome Hub - ready website package
Files:
- index.html
- about.html
- services.html
- contact.html
- style.css
- script.js

How to use:
1. Download the zip and extract.
2. Rename index.html if needed, but keep files in same folder.
3. Upload all files to your GitHub repository (smartincomehub).
4. In Settings -> Pages choose Branch: main, folder: root and save.
5. Your site will be live at https://<your-github-username>.github.io/smartincomehub/

If you want Form integration (Formspree / Netlify) I can add that.
